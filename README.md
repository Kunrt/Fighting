                                                  Fighting

                                  People's joys and sorrows are not interlinked

                                  You see, he smiles like a warm little sun

                                  But I don't know how many uncrusted wounds he has in his heart

                                  A lot of time, the crowd is full of traffic

                                  But you just feel like you're the only one around you

                                        In fact, everyone is like this

                                          After all, in this world

                                            Never really felt it
